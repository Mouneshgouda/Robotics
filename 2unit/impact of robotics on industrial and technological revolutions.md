# 🏭 Impact of Robotics on Industrial and Technological Revolutions

## ⚙️ 1. First Industrial Revolution (Late 18th – Early 19th Century)
- **Mechanization** of production using water and steam power
- Set the stage for automation, though robotics was not yet developed

## ⚡ 2. Second Industrial Revolution (Late 19th – Early 20th Century)
- **Mass production** and **electrification** of factories
- **Automation tools** (e.g., conveyor belts, mechanical arms) laid groundwork for industrial robots

## 🦾 3. Third Industrial Revolution (Late 20th Century)
- **Digital Revolution**: Rise of electronics, IT, and programmable systems
- **Industrial robots** introduced (Unimate, FANUC, KUKA)
- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers)** replaced manual control
- **Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)** and **robotic arms** improved productivity and safety

## 🤖 4. Fourth Industrial Revolution (21st Century – Present)
- **Integration of AI, IoT, and robotics** (Industry 4.0)
- **Smart factories**: Autonomous robots, real-time data analytics
- **Cobots** work alongside humans in collaborative settings
- **Cloud robotics**, **edge computing**, and **machine learning** enhance autonomy and adaptability

## 🌐 Broader Technological Impacts
- **Healthcare**: Robotic surgery, rehabilitation, diagnostics
- **Logistics**: Warehouse automation, autonomous vehicles, drones
- **Agriculture**: Precision farming, autonomous tractors, crop monitoring robots
- **Space Exploration**: Robotic rovers, probes, and repair bots (e.g., Mars rovers, Canadarm)
- **Consumer Tech**: Domestic robots (vacuums, lawnmowers), personal assistants
