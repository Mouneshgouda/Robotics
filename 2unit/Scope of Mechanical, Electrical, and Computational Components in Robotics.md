📌 **Scope**: Structure, motion, and physical interaction with the environment

### ✅ Key Areas:
- **Chassis / Body Design**: Frames, joints, and load-bearing structures
- **Actuators**: Convert electrical signals into motion (e.g., motors, hydraulic cylinders)
- **Linkages and Mechanisms**: Robotic arms, wheels, legs, gears, cams
- **End-effectors**: Grippers, tools, suction cups, cutting devices
- **Mobility Systems**: Tracks, wheels, legs (for walking robots)

🧠 **Role**:  
Defines the physical capabilities of the robot (range of motion, strength, speed, etc.)

📌 **Scope**: Power, sensing, and signal transmission

### ✅ Key Areas:
- **Power Systems**: Batteries, power converters, distribution boards
- **Motors and Drivers**: DC motors, stepper motors, servos, ESCs (motor controllers)
- **Sensors**:
  - Proximity (IR, ultrasonic)
  - Position (encoders, potentiometers)
  - Vision (cameras, LiDAR)
  - Environmental (temperature, pressure, gas)
- **Wiring & PCBs**: Circuit boards for control and signal routing

🧠 **Role**:  
Provides the interface between control logic and the physical world—enabling perception, feedback, and actuation.

📌 **Scope**: Control, decision-making, and intelligence

### ✅ Key Areas:
- **Microcontrollers / Embedded Systems**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, STM32
- **Control Systems**: PID controllers, trajectory planning, feedback loops
- **Software Architecture**: Robot Operating System (ROS), middleware
- **AI / ML**:
  - Vision processing (object detection, tracking)
  - Path planning (A*, RRT)
  - Behavior learning (reinforcement learning)
- **Communication**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, CAN bus, serial protocols

🧠 **Role**:  
This is the "brain" of the robot—processing sensor data, making decisions, and sending control signals.
