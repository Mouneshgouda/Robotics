# 🤖 Real-Time Line-Following Robot – Flowchart Explanation

## 📘 Overview

This document explains the step-by-step flow of a **line-following robot** using a basic flowchart. This type of robot is commonly used in warehouses, logistics, and robotics education.

## 🛠️ Real-Time Explanation

### 🟢 Start
- The robot powers on and gets ready to begin the task.

### ⚙️ Initialize Sensors and Motors
- IR sensors and motors are initialized.
- The robot calibrates its sensors to detect black (line) and white (background).

### 🔍 Read IR Sensors
- Continuously reads left and right IR sensors to check the line position.

### ❓ Is Robot Centered on Line?
- **If yes**: The robot moves straight forward.
- **If no**: The robot is veering off the line.

### 🔄 Adjust Direction
- **If left sensor sees white, right sees black**: turn left.
- **If right sees white, left sees black**: turn right.

### ✅ Move Forward
- If both sensors detect black, the robot is centered and moves forward.

### 🧱 Is End of Line Reached?
- If both sensors read white: robot has reached the end of the line.

### 🔁 Loop Back
- If the end hasn't been reached, the robot loops back to continue following the line.

### 🛑 Stop Motors and End
- Once the end is reached, the robot stops its motors and halts the task.

## 🏭 Real-World Application

This behavior is typical in:
- **Warehouse logistics** (e.g., Amazon Kiva robots)
- **Educational robots** like LEGO Mindstorms, Line follower kits
- **Autonomous carts** for material handling

## ✅ Summary

This flowchart and logic demonstrate the foundation of reactive, sensor-driven robotic systems using basic feedback loops.
