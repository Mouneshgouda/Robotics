Robotics is the branch of engineering and science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots‚Äîmachines that can sense, plan, and act in the physical world. It combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence.

Robots are used in manufacturing, space exploration, healthcare, military, agriculture, and daily life (e.g., vacuum robots, drones).

Robotics continues to evolve, blending physical engineering with smart AI to reshape industries and daily life.


# üß† Robotics Today

Modern robotics fuses:

- **AI and machine learning** (for perception and decision-making)
- 
- **Sensors and actuators** (to interact with the environment)
- **Cloud robotics and edge computing**

The field continues to evolve toward **intelligent**, **adaptive**, and **socially aware** robots.
