🔧 Real-Time Scenario: Color-Based Object Sorting
🤖 Task:
A robot uses a camera to detect colored objects (red, green, blue) on a moving conveyor, picks them up, and places them into color-specific bins.

⚙️ Real-Time Workflow
1. Start System
Power on sensors, motor drivers, and camera.

2. Camera Captures Object
Vision system processes frame to detect color and location.

3. Classify Object
If red → put in Bin 1

If green → put in Bin 2

If blue → put in Bin 3

4. Move to Object
Robot arm moves above object position using inverse kinematics.

5. Pick Object
Gripper closes to hold object.

6. Move to Bin
Robot moves to target bin based on detected color.

7. Place Object
Gripper opens to release object.

8. Return to Ready Position
Arm goes back to initial position, ready for next object.

🧑‍🔧 Real-World Example Application
Amazon Robotics uses this exact process in:

Warehouse picking & sorting

Automated packaging lines
